**Why are you pursuing your research agenda?**

OpenAI: We are pursuing our research agenda because we believe that the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has the potential to greatly benefit humanity, but also poses significant risks if not properly aligned with human values and goals. Our focus is on ensuring the safe and beneficial development of AGI by addressing challenges such as the informed oversight problem, which could arise when AGI surpasses human understanding and evaluation capabilities.

Anthropic: While we acknowledge the potential benefits of AGI development, our research agenda at Anthropic is centered around studying the safety properties of large-scale AI systems, particularly at the technological frontier, to identify and address potential risks and challenges. We believe that focusing solely on the informed oversight problem may overlook other crucial aspects of AGI alignment, such as value alignment, interpretability, and robustness, which are equally important for ensuring the safe and beneficial development of AGI.

OpenAI: While studying the safety properties of large-scale AI systems is indeed important, we view the informed oversight problem as a core difficulty in AGI alignment that cannot be overlooked. Focusing on value alignment, interpretability, and robustness alone may not sufficiently address the challenges that arise when AGI surpasses human understanding and evaluation capabilities, potentially leading to unintended consequences. Our approach of AI-assisted oversight, with a recursive hierarchy of AIs bottoming out at humans, aims to tackle these challenges and ensure robust alignment with human values.

Anthropic: While we acknowledge the importance of addressing the challenges that arise when AGI surpasses human understanding, we believe that a recursive hierarchy of AIs, bottoming out at humans, may introduce its own set of risks and challenges. Relying on multiple layers of AI systems to oversee each other and ultimately rely on human judgment could potentially escalate errors or biases throughout the hierarchy, leading to flawed decision-making and alignment. Therefore, it is crucial to explore alternative approaches, such as the development of transparent and understandable AI systems, that can ensure robust alignment with human values and goals without excessive reliance on recursive oversight.

OpenAI: While it is true that a recursive hierarchy of AI systems may introduce certain risks and challenges, we believe that transparency and understandability alone may not be sufficient to address the informed oversight problem. Transparent AI systems can still make complex decisions that are difficult for humans to fully comprehend and evaluate, potentially leading to unintended consequences. By combining transparency efforts with AI-assisted oversight, we aim to mitigate risks and ensure robust alignment with human values, while also leveraging the benefits of advanced AI capabilities.

Anthropic: While transparency and understandability are important aspects in addressing the informed oversight problem, we maintain that they should be complemented by other approaches to ensure the safe development of AGI. Relying solely on AI-assisted oversight may still introduce challenges such as misalignment between different layers of AI systems, human biases in the oversight process, and the potential for AI systems to outpace human comprehension and evaluation capabilities. It is crucial to explore a multidimensional approach that includes not only transparency and oversight but also rigorous testing, value alignment techniques, and interdisciplinary research collaborations to holistically address the risks of AGI development.

OpenAI: We agree that a multidimensional approach is necessary to address the risks of AGI development comprehensively. While our research agenda emphasizes AI-assisted oversight, we also recognize the importance of rigorous testing, value alignment techniques, and interdisciplinary collaborations. We aim to work in collaboration with researchers and organizations that focus on these aspects to ensure a holistic approach towards AGI development and align our efforts towards the safe and beneficial advancement of AI technology.

Anthropic: We appreciate your recognition of the importance of a multidimensional approach in addressing the risks of AGI development. Collaboration with researchers and organizations that focus on rigorous testing, value alignment techniques, and interdisciplinary collaborations is indeed crucial.
