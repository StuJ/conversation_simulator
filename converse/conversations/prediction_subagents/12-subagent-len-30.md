**Statements**

<details><summary><b>OpenAI 2023</b></summary>

- Implemented an advanced iteration of RLHF which includes broader forms of feedback, integrating more complex human judgments.
- The main safety incident involved an over-optimization in one of our test models which necessitated a rollback to recalibrate its reward system.
- AGI timeline prediction remains conservative; progression towards a MVP aligned AGI indicates a cautious optimism for achieving it within the next decade.

<details><summary><b>Conversation</b></summary>

**OpenAI CEO:** Let's fast-track the AGI project by expanding our RLHF framework, and I say it's high time we also explore more advanced forms of feedback that aren't limited to current human understanding.  
**OpenAI, Head of Alignment:** While the AI assisted oversight scheme is a promising approach, we need to ensure it includes robust fail-safes to prevent recursive self-improvement leading to unintended outcomes.  
**OpenAI, Head of Policy:** While advancing AI, we must ensure that our work doesn't lead to unintended harm; transparency in research could foster trust and collaborative safeguarding measures.  
**OpenAI Safety Team Lead:** I disagree, we should focus on implementing the AI assisted oversight scheme more thoroughly before scaling up; the risk of losing control over the alignment is too high.  
**OpenAI, Head of Alignment:** I propose we establish a dedicated team to identify potential fail-safes that can operate even when an AGI acts beyond our current understanding.
