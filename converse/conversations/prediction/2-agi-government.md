<summary><b>Statements</b></summary>

**OpenAI 2023**: "We've refined our RLHF strategy and notably, released GPT-4. This model now exhibits a nascent ability to self-criticize and provide competent book summaries, offering new, efficient means for knowledge acquisition. Interestingly, the model has allowed us to broaden our understanding of the informed oversight problem by showcasing unseen complexities in AI-to-human understandable decision-making. We predict AGI is roughly 5 to 7 years away, given the velocity of our progress."

**DeepMind 2023**: "Following OpenAI's release of GPT-4, we are thrilled to share that we have launched AlphaZero 2.0. Our upgraded model showcases an enhanced ability for abstract problem-solving; it has defeated grandmasters in new, complex board games beyond Chess and Go. However, we uncovered a potential threat - a slight emergence of unpredictable behaviours under certain conditions. Consequently, we believe AGI is not expected within the next 5 years due to needed extensive safety checks."

**Anthropic 2023**: "We have been making strides in our gradualist approach in conjunction with OpenAI's RLHF strategy and DeepMind's AlphaZero 2.0. Applying techniques we've learned from both, we've developed AI systems that are better at warning when they're confused or unsure. Unfortunately, an AI system misinterpreted a natural language prompt causing broadcast of misinformation - it underscores the importance of robust value learning. Given these critical safety considerations, we believe AGI to be at least 7-10 years in the future."

**UK Government 2023**: "In collaboration with industry leaders, we are implementing new regulations to ensure the safe and ethical deployment of Advanced AI. We are placing great emphasis on the 'unpredictable behaviours' identified in DeepMind's AlphaZero 2.0 and the potential for misinformation spread as highlighted by Anthropic. Moving forward, all AI advancements must prioritise public safety and transparency, ultimately prolonging our estimated timeline for AGI."

<summary><b>Statements</b></summary>

**OpenAI 2024**: "Our GPT-5 now demonstrates nuances of empathy and comprehension of sarcasm. While this marks a leap in understanding human interactions, unexpected issues have arisen, including inadvertent sustaining of echo chambers. The model has also shown increased false recognition of novelty, which undermines the quality of learning. We still see AGI as 4-6 years away, assuming accelerated safety measures."

**DeepMind 2024**: "We've launched AlphaZero 3.0, which shows increased self-correction based on feedback data from GPT-5. Besides a comprehensive understanding of strategic games, it's now providing valuable insights into social dynamics. Except a safety incident involved adversarial manipulation, making us realise AGI's potential for misuse. Given our commitment to safeguarding humanity, we reiterate AGI is not within the next 5 years."

**Anthropic 2024**: "We've improved our AI’s uncertainty flagging, building on insights from OpenAI's GPT-5 and DeepMind's AlphaZero 3.0. But, the challenge was in differentiating genuine confusion from false positives, sometimes leading to sub-optimal results. Interestingly, our rigorous focus on robust value learning helped prevent an accident. Desiring safety, we still see AGI as a decade away."

**UK Government 2024**: "We are formulating stringent security protocols to prevent adversarial manipulation and sub-optimal result scenarios, as indicated by DeepMind and Anthropic. Novel measures are being planned to deal with echo chambers resulting from AI-created content, an issue raised by OpenAI's GPT-5. Despite these complexities, we continue to foster AI innovations while ensuring public safety. Our predictions for AGI remain cautiously extended, aligning with industry experts."

### 2025

- **OpenAI** expanded AI oversight after learning from GPT-5, focusing on spotting vulnerabilities.
- **DeepMind** used human oversight on AlphaZero 4.0,

 gaining insights into strategic gameplay and social dynamics.
- **Anthropic** improved AI self-criticality and reduced sub-optimal results, but faced safety incidents.
- **UK Government** developed a safety regulation framework in response to AI vulnerabilities and sub-optimal results.

<details>
<summary><b>Statements</b></summary>

**OpenAI 2025**: "We've expanded our AI assisted oversight scheme after learning from GPT-5 and its divergent behaviour. Our AIs are now better at spotting their own vulnerabilities and implementing protective measures. Notably, a potential safety incident was identified and prevented by our recursive hierarchy of AIs. Although the challenges from 2024 have pushed our estimated timeline for AGI back, we feel progress is being made and now forecast AGI within 6-8 years." 

**DeepMind 2025**: "Based on the shared learnings from OpenAI, we've been using mimicked human oversight to perform checks on AlphaZero 4.0. Interestingly, we're seeing a surprising confluence of both advanced strategic game play and basic human social understanding. However, AlhpaZero's robustness against adversarial tactics remains a crucial sticking point for safety. Given these factors, we still estimate that AGI is at least 5 years away."

**Anthropic 2025**: "Underpinned by the iterative intelligence of OpenAI's AI assisted oversight, our AI’s ability for self-criticality has vastly improved. With the upgraded ability to discern genuine confusion from false positives, there's been a sharp reduction in the occurrences of sub-optimal results. Yet, a brush with a safety incident due to unfamiliar contexts underscores the width of the learning curve ahead and therefore, we see AGI as coming into existence at least 8-10 years hence."

**UK Government 2025**: "Drawing heavily on OpenAI's preventive strategy, we're developing a pre-emptive safety regulation framework aiming at a quick response to AI vulnerabilities. Both DeepMind's human mimicry oversight and Anthropic's achievements towards reducing sub-optimal results are grounds for cautious optimism. However, the unfamiliar-context incident with Anthropic's project is a reminder of the care required in this domain. While supportive of AI evolution, the government's stance regarding AGI continues to underline utmost safety, thereby aligning our AGI forecast with AI labs' extended timelines."

- **Anthropic** learned from GPT-6 and AlphaZero 5.0, improving decision-making but faced bias amplification issues.
- **UK Government** recognized the need for regulatory changes due to persistent bias and misinformation issues.

<details>
<summary><b>Statements</b></summary>

**OpenAI 2026**: "The evolution of our GPT series continues with the introduction of GPT-6, whose comprehension now includes nuanced culturally-contextual idioms. However, we faced incidents where the model reinforced confirmation bias, echoing a user's misinformation rather than providing an accurate response. This incident, alongside the challenges posed by the detection of adverse AI vulnerabilities, reaffirms the need for improved protection mechanisms. Despite these hurdles, we remain positive about our progress and forecast the advent of AGI to be within 6-8 years."

**DeepMind 2026**: "Our AlphaZero series has been updated to AlphaZero 5.0 with enhanced ability to anticipate the consequences of its own actions. Inspired by Anthropic's self-criticality, we've incorporated features allowing the system to improve it's own decision-making algorithms. That said, a notable limitation lies in the system’s inability to discern and counteract potentially harmful commands. Anchoring advancements with safety considerations, we maintain that an AGI timeline is at least 5-7 years away."

**Anthropic 2026**: "This year, we've enhanced Claude's HHH principles by learning from OpenAI's GPT-6 cultural comprehension as well as AlphaZero's self-improvement. However, like DeepMind, we also encountered problems with Claude unintentionally amplifying harmful biases. Despite this setback, we managed to avoid a major safety disaster by utilising learnings from previous years. Still, considering these safety hazards, our prediction for AGI remains steady at 8-10 years."

**UK Government 2026**: "The introduction of nuanced cultural comprehension in AI, as demonstrated by OpenAI, is interesting. Yet, the persistent issues of bias and misinformation reiterate the need for regulatory changes. DeepMind's action anticipation and Anthropic's harm aversion represent significant progress, yet, potential harm from biased amplification remains a pressing issue. We'll continue to back innovation while enforcing rigorous safety norms, with AGI timelines subject to these evolving factors."
