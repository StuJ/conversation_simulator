<summary>OpenAI 2022</summary>

- Expanded the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by incorporating more diverse and complex human evaluations.
- Encountered challenges with AI models exhibiting behaviors that were difficult to align due to their complexity, leading to temporary shutdowns for safety evaluations.
- Predicted that AGI is still several significant breakthroughs away, estimating a cautious timeline beyond the next decade.

<details>
<summary><strong>Conversation</strong></summary>

**OpenAI CEO**: Yo team, I say we double down on scaling up RLHF, maybe even push the envelope with more complex simulations so our AI can handle that 5D chess.

**OpenAI, Head of Alignment**: We should prioritize developing tighter control protocols for RLHF to mitigate risks before pushing to scale up our AI's capabilities.

**OpenAI, Head of Policy**: We should prioritize policy frameworks for overseeing our AI's development to ensure transparency and prevent misuse, even if it means slowing down our MVP AGI project.

**OpenAI Safety Team**: But we've got to tread carefully and ensure these complex simulations are closely monitored—we can’t afford to have any unintended behaviors amplified.

**OpenAI, Head of Alignment**: That's a technologically appealing pursuit, but without iterative checks and balances, we may inadvertently scale unsafe behaviors.
