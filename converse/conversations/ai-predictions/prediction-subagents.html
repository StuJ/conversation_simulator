<h2>Anthropic Conversation</h2>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">CEO</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Anthropic, CEO: This year, I believe we should focus on advancing the interpretability of our AI models to ensure we understand their decision-making processes. There are risks involved, such as uncovering undesirable biases or behaviors in models that could damage public trust, but the potential for creating truly reliable and safe AI is paramount. It's critical that our users have confidence in how our technologies arrive at their outputs, especially as we deploy more advanced systems like Claude.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Head of Alignment</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Anthropic, Head of Alignment: For this year, we should prioritize scaling our alignment techniques while ensuring that their quality and precision are not compromised. We need to secure more computational resources, possibly through partnerships or grants, to support the development of these methods. Lastly, we should focus on applying the HHH framework to new domains, potentially high-risk areas such as healthcare or autonomous systems, to test and improve the robustness of our AI models.</p>
